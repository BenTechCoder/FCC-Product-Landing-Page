                    <h2>Shipping details</h2>
                    <p>Our remote location in Alaska makes it harder to ship products to the US and even harder to ship products abroad. Please forgive the wait times and delays, we believe that our location is an advantage when it comes to building the best Acoustic and Electric Guitars we can make.
                        We make sure each Guitar is on it's way right after we make it for quick and speedy shipping. If your not satisfied with your purchase we'll provide free returns at no extra charge.
